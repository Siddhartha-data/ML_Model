# ML_Model Wine Quality Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts wine quality based on various chemical properties.

## Key Features
- Dataset: Wine composition and quality labels.
- Model: Random Forest Classifier.
- Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.

## Instructions
- Open the `Wine_Quality.ipynb` file for full implementation details.



# HR Logistic Model
This repository contains the implementation of a Logistic Regression model for Human Resources (HR) analytics. The model aims to predict employee-related outcomes, such as which employee left or retained the company on historical HR data.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key patterns and insights.
- Model Training: Implements Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks.

# Iris Flower Classification using SVM
This repository contains an SVM (Support Vector Machine)-based solution for classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project uses the classic Iris dataset, which is widely used in machine learning for classification tasks.

 ## Features
 - Data Preprocessing: Prepares the dataset with feature scaling and train-test splitting.
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes relationships between features and class labels.
 - Model Training: Implements SVM with both linear and non-linear kernels for classification.
 - Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes the model using techniques like grid search or random search.
 - Model Evaluation: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizations such as confusion matrices.
 - Visualization: Includes decision boundary plots for linear and non-linear kernels.
