# ML_Model Wine Quality Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts wine quality based on various chemical properties.

## Key Features
- Dataset: Wine composition and quality labels.
- Model: Random Forest Classifier.
- Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.

## Instructions
- Open the `Wine_Quality.ipynb` file for full implementation details.



## HR Logistic Model
This repository contains the implementation of a Logistic Regression model for Human Resources (HR) analytics. The model aims to predict employee-related outcomes, such as which employee left or retained the company on historical HR data.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key patterns and insights.
- Model Training: Implements Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks.
